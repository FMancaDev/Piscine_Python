This repository contains the solutions for the “Python for Data Science – 0 Starting” module from the 42 school Piscine.
The objective is to practice and consolidate fundamental Python concepts: data types, control flow, argument parsing, scripting structure, and clean coding — all following the official subject instructions.

## 🎯 Objectives  
Each exercise is designed to reinforce essential programming concepts and help you build a solid foundation in Python — particularly useful for Data Science or general software development learning paths.
